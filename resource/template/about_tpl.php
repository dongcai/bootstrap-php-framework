          <h1>About DeNiX</h1>

          <p>DeNiX is nick name of bootstrap-php-framework.</p>
          
          <p>DeNiX is kind of MVC framework and powered by the latest bootstrap 3 (my favorite fton-end framework.) It may not be qualified as a formal framework because it's too simple, just contains a few files with very limit functions.
              But it may be enough for your next PHP project. </p>
          <p>I believe Simple is KEY. Never overkill if you just want to build a simple site or application. </p>
